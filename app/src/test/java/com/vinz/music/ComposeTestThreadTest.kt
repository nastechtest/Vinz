/**
 * Why the TV's in-app tests failed with "multithreaded access to SnapshotStateObserver" and "Only the original thread
 * that created a view hierarchy can touch its views" (1.8.0): the test rules from androidx.compose.ui.test.junit4 run
 * the composition's coroutines on an UnconfinedTestDispatcher, so an effect that does some work in the background
 * (withContext(Dispatchers.Default), as Vinz's pages do) carries on on that background thread, and the composition's
 * next frame with it. The v2 rules run them on a StandardTestDispatcher, which the test clock runs on the main thread:
 * what the app itself does (its effects always come back to the main thread). The TV's in-app tests that wait only
 * through the rule (Ambient, Browse, Lyrics, Shell, Sing) use the v2 rules; the ones that also wait on the player by
 * sleeping (Link, Playback, Video, Home customize) keep the old ones: with v2, an effect runs only when the test waits
 * through the rule. So does Settings: there Home's first focus, a moment late under v2, took focus back from the side
 * navigation now and then on the slow TV.
