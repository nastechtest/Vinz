/**
 * Search finds the song a title is known for (owner, 1.8.0 on the TV: "upside down" didn't show Jack Johnson's song,
 * a trending Hazbin Hotel song of the same name took the top card). Live against YouTube Music, signed out, so it reads
 * what a new listener gets. A title shared by several artists should lead with the one most people mean: the most
 * played. 2026-11-01: 22 of 30 led with the song meant before search read play counts (the owner's 4 of 7: upside
 * down, hello and dreams missed), 30 of 30 after. Later that day YouTube's card for "yesterday" became the 2019 film's
 * soundtrack album and for "africa" a new 2026 album: both give way to the song now.
