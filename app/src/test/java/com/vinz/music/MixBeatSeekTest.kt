 * #210 (1.8.0): a tempo-matched crossfade never plays anything twice. When the next song's beats came in off the ending
 * song's, a big gap was closed by moving the next song back by the gap from its reported position, which replays what
 * was just heard (up to half a beat), and more when that reported position was stale (it lags by up to a few hundred
 * ms while a player is busy). Now it only ever moves on, to the next place where the beats line up.
