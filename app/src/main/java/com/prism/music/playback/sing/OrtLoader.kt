/**
 * Starts ONNX Runtime with its engine from Sing's download (the 13+ MB library isn't in the APK). The small Java
 * bridge is in the APK, and ONNX Runtime loads it by name; it needs the engine, which Android's linker finds by the
 * engine's name once it's loaded. So the engine is loaded here first, by its full path, and ONNX Runtime starts as
 * usual after that.
 *
 * This has to work the first time: a class that failed to start can't be started again in the same run of Prism.
