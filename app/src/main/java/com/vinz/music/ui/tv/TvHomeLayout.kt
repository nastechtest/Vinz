 * The TV's Home and its layout (1.8.0; the owner: "You should be able to customize the homescreen", then "I do not see
 * things like Vinz Music mixes or Quick picks etc. that match my phone app"). Every phone Home section a TV can show
 * is a row here, by the phone's own key ([TvHomeLayout.CATALOG], plus pinned items and rules, "pin:*" / "rule:*", and
 * YouTube's shelves), so one layout drives both:
 * - Which rows show: the phone's own Home layout ([com.vinz.music.data.prefs.AppSettings.homeLayout]). A row it names
 *   shows or hides as it says (a row hidden on one is hidden on the other); a row it doesn't name shows only if the TV's
 *   Home always had it (the hero, Quick picks, Speed dial, Recently played, and YouTube's shelves while the phone adds
 *   them, `autoAddSections`). The TV's own now-playing hero is shown or hidden in the TV's layout
 *   ([com.vinz.music.data.prefs.TvPrefs.homeLayout]).
 * - Their order: the TV's layout once the TV's editor has been used; before that the phone's order (a fresh TV mirrors
 *   the phone), with the rows the phone doesn't place after, in [TvHomeLayout.CATALOG]'s order, then YouTube's.
 * Rows with nothing in them (no plays yet for On repeat) leave themselves out.
 * Back to default: no TV layout, and the rows the TV's Home always had shown again.
