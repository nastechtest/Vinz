/**
 * "YouTube Music (live)" (1.8.1): while signed in and turned on in Bring your history, every few hours Vinz reads the
 * account's YouTube Music History page (one request) and counts the songs newly at the top since the last read as plays
 * from elsewhere (the YouTube Music app, the website, a speaker), a source of its own: Replay counts it only when
 * switched on under "Count history from", and Remove takes it away as any import.
 *
 * - The first read after turning it on is only the starting point: nothing from before is brought in (Takeout brings
 *   the past). So is the first read after a week without one, or for another account.
 * - Times are estimates: spread over the time between two reads, each day's songs on their side of midnight.
 * - A song played twice between two reads is on the page once, so it counts once.
 * - Vinz's own plays (which Vinz reports to that history) are left out: any song Vinz played or reported in the
 *   window, by its id or its name (the rule Takeout's plays get, 3 minutes before to 15 after, held to the window).
 *   So are plays a Takeout already brought; one a Takeout brings later is taken out then.
 * - Each play counts as the song's length (estimated, as Takeout's) and is matched at once: the page names the song.
 * - Nothing on the account or in Vinz is ever deleted by it. [guard]: five failures running pause it for a day.
