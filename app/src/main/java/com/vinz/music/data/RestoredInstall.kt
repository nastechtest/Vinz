 * Android's own backup (to Google, or copied phone to phone) brings Vinz's files to a new install. The sign-ins kept
 * in files of their own stay out of it (res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml, backup_rules.xml), but the YouTube Music
 * sign-in lives with the settings, which should come along. So a restored copy signs out of it once, at start.
 *
 * A restore is told from an update by the time Android installed the app: the one saved in [PREFS] (which is backed up
 * with the rest) belongs to another install. Vinz's own backups leave [PREFS] out, so restoring one of those, with
 * its accounts, signs nothing out.
