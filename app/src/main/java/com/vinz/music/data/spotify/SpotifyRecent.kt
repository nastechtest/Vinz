/**
 * "Recent plays" (1.8.1): what the listener played in Spotify, read from its recently played list (its last 50, all
 * the API gives) every few hours, and stored as imported plays from "Spotify (live)", a source of its own: Replay
 * counts it only when switched on under "Count history from", and Remove takes it away like any import.
 *
 * Spotify doesn't say how long each was heard, so a play counts as the song's length (estimated, held to the matched
 * song's length as other estimated plays are). A play a data download already has (the same song within [TWIN_MS]) is
 * left out, and one a download brings later is taken out then ([SpotifyDao.dropLiveTwins]).
