/**
 * The plays an earlier import of one source brought (1.8.1, repeat imports), to know a play in a newer download that is
 * already here: the same song within [WINDOW_MS] of the same time is the same play. That covers a fresh copy of the same
 * download (the same times), and Spotify's two histories, whose times differ: the account data's to the minute, the
 * extended one's to the second.
 *
 * The two histories can also name a song's artist differently (the account data the song's own artist, the extended
 * one the album's: "Calvin Harris" against "Calvin Harris, Rihanna", or a featured singer's song on another's album).
 * So a play whose song isn't found by its name is also looked for by its title alone, among stored songs whose artist
 * is related to its own ([related]): one name inside the other, or an artist both credits name. Two songs that share a
 * title but no artist (two different "Stay"s in the same minute) stay two plays.
 *
 * Each stored play stands for one play of the new download at most (a song skipped and played again a minute later is
 * two plays in both). Between the two Spotify histories the extended play is the whole story: where a newer download's
 * extended play meets an account-data play stored before, [absorb] says to [Hit.Upgrade] that row in place.
