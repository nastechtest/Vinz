/**
 * Checks on word-by-word timings (#301: "word-by-word lyrics don't line up with the vocals" from Better Lyrics,
 * LyricsPlus and the other word sources, while line-by-line lyrics were fine).
 *
 * Two ways they go wrong that Vinz can tell without listening:
 *  - **Timings that aren't the words'**: words stamped outside their own line, out of order, or every word in a line
 *    the same length (a line's time shared out evenly, not sung). Such lyrics are shown by their lines instead
 *    ([checked]), so a source with real word timings, or the line timing, wins.
 *  - **A whole set early or late**: word sources are Apple Music's, timed to Apple's copy of the song, and some of
 *    YouTube's copies start a little sooner or later (another master, a longer intro). Line-timed lyrics of the same
 *    song (YouTube Music's own, LRCLIB's: what the listener found right) show it: when the lines agree on one steady
 *    difference ([offsetAgainst]), the words are moved by it ([shifted]).
