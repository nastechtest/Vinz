/**
 * What the listener made of Vinz's recommendations (1.7.9), kept on the phone: which songs Vinz served on which day
 * (a Daily Mix, the time-of-day mix, radio and autoplay), and which of those they skipped straight away or heard
 * through. Plays under ten seconds never reach the play history, so before this a recommendation skipped at once
 * left no trace and came back the next day.
 * - Served songs rest for a few days ([servedDaysAgo], [Variety.rest]): tomorrow's mixes don't repeat today's.
 * - A song skipped from a recommendation ([turnedDown]): a new one once, one you know twice, is left out of them
 *   for [Variety.SKIP_DAYS] days. Hearing it through clears that.
 * - An artist whose recommended songs are skipped again and again, and never heard through, counts for less
 *   ([artistDoubt]).
