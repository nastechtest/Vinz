/**
 * What keeps Vinz's recommendations from going round in circles (1.7.9, Reddit: "it always plays the same songs").
 * Pure, so it's unit-tested apart from where the songs come from:
 * - [rest]: how much a song the listener knows is held back today (played a lot lately, served in yesterday's mixes);
 * - [sample]: the familiar part of a mix drawn by weighted chance, so every song that fits gets its turn, not the
 *   same top thirty every day;
 * - [arrange]: a mix's order, familiar and new in turn, its artists spread out (a few songs each at most, never two
 *   running) and taken in turn across the mix's artists rather than mostly the first one.
