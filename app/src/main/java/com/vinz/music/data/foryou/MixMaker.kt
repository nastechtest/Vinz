/**
 * How a mix is made (1.7.9), apart from where its data comes from, so a week of mixes can be tried in a test:
 * 1. **Familiar**: songs the listener knows that fit the mix, drawn by weighted chance ([Variety.sample]) from all of
 *    them, each held back while it rests ([Variety.rest]: heard lately, on repeat, served in the last few days'
 *    mixes). Before, it was the same top thirty every day.
 * 2. **New**: found from a few of today's familiar picks (so the seeds change with them) through three ways at once:
 *    YouTube Music's radio of the song, its Related tab ("You might also like") and its similar artists' top songs. A
 *    song several of them agree on counts more. Nothing played in the last 90 days, nothing turned down
 *    ([RecFeedback]), and artists whose recommendations get skipped count for less. Drawn by chance as well, best
 *    weighted, so two days' new songs aren't the same.
 * 3. **Order**: [Variety.arrange]: new songs spread through it at [Recipe.freshShare], each artist a few times at most
 *    and never twice running, the mix's own artists taking turns.
