 * addresses (IPv4 and IPv6, its Wi-Fi and its Ethernet, a TV's Thread radio), and the phone kept just one: the first
 * IPv4 address, or on Android 13 and older the one address Android's lookup gave, often an IPv6 link-local one that can't
 * be connected to as it came. Now every address is kept, the likeliest first, and each is tried in turn; and when none
 * answers, the listener is told what actually went wrong.
