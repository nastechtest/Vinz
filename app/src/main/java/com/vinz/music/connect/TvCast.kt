/**
 * Playing on a Vinz TV (1.8.0), the phone's side, as casting is: the phone's own player carries on, muted, so the
 * queue, the notification, lyrics and play counts all go on as ever, and it leads what plays. Whenever that changes
 * (a song, play or pause, a seek, the queue, shuffle, repeat) the TV is sent the songs around the one playing
 * ([FollowState], [TvSync.window]); the TV leads where, so the phone's playhead follows the TV's ([TvSync.follow]).
 * What's done on the TV (its remote, its queue) comes back as [TvAct]s and is done here too. Runs on the main thread;
 * the connection's reading on a thread of its own, its writing on another.
