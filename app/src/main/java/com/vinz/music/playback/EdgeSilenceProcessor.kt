/**
 * Skip silence for songs (#210, 1.8.0): only the silence before a song's first sound and after its last is left out,
 * never a pause inside it. Media3's own skipper, which songs used before, shortened every pause longer than a tenth of
 * a second (a breath before the last chorus, a stop in a song); podcast episodes still get that one.
 *
 * Which song plays and how long it is comes from the player (on every seek and new song, [onFlush]); across a gapless
 * move to the next song, which the player doesn't announce here, the processor counts its way to the next one, as
 * Sing's VocalStemProcessor does, by the player's timeline as it is now ([timelineChanged]). A song's silent start is
 * held back and dropped when its first sound comes within [EDGE_SECONDS] (a longer one is a quiet intro, played
 * whole); in its last [EDGE_SECONDS], silence is held back, then dropped if the song ends in it or let through if sound
 * comes back. What's dropped is counted
 * ([Chain]) so the playing position, and the lyrics with it, stay where the sound is, as with Media3's skipper.
