/**
 * Crossfade (after Spotify's): when a song runs into the next one, the ending song fades out while the next one fades
 * in, both at their own speed, instead of one stopping and the next starting. Its length is the listener's, or with
 * [auto] it's worked out for each pair of songs ([autoLengthMs]): over the ending song's own fade-out when it has
 * one, over the next song's quiet intro when the ending is abrupt, and briefly when neither gives room.
 *
 * How a blend goes: a few seconds before it, a second player ([buildTail]) gets the ending song ready at the same
 * spot, muted. Just before the blend it starts playing along, and its audio is shifted until it's in step with the
 * main player (it's still silent). At the blend the main player hands over: the tail carries on the ending song,
 * and the main player moves to the next song, starting where its music starts (or on its first beat), silent, then
 * fading in while the tail fades out (equal power, so the loudness holds). With beat matching (a DJ-style option,
 * off unless chosen), the next song plays at the ending song's tempo while they overlap (pitch kept), its beats lined
 * up with the ending song's, and drifts back to its own tempo once the ending song is gone.
 *
 * The main player moves on to the next song as the blend starts (as Spotify's does), so the player, lyrics,
 * history and the car's screen are all about the incoming song from then on.
