/**
 * Which way Sing tells voices apart on this device (1.8.x, "Sing on as many devices as possible"), from how fast each
 * network way has gone here: seconds of song separated a second, with the player sharing the device all the while.
 * Measured on 50 songs with their real parts (MUSDB18's excerpts), the light way's backing comes within 0.1 dB of the
 * full way's (11.6 against 11.7 dB, median) in about two thirds of the time, and the quick way's 7.2 dB is still well
 * clear of the song as it is (4.5 dB); so the full way where it's well ahead, the light way where it keeps up, the quick
 * way where neither does or the engine can't run.
